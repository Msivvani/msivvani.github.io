Hi! I’m **Sivvani**, a second-year graduate student in the **MRSD program** at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, actively seeking full-time positions in **perception and localization**.

I recently worked as a **Robotics Intern** at [Nissan Advanced Technology Center](https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ADVANCED_TECH_CENTER/), where I contributed to advancing **GPS-denied navigation systems** for indoor environments. This experience honed my ability to develop innovative solutions for autonomous systems, focusing on practical challenges in real-world scenarios.

Currently, I am a Teaching Assistant for the SLAM course (16-833) with Professor [Michael Kaess](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/michael-kaess/), a renowned figure in the SLAM community. Working alongside him has been an incredible opportunity to deepen my expertise in this transformative field. For my **MRSD capstone project**, I led efforts to generate **bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations** of environments using external infrastructure cameras. This work tackled the challenge of enabling seamless teleoperation for vehicle parking in complex scenarios, providing intuitive and scalable solutions.

I am passionate about addressing complex challenges in robotics, particularly in **robot perception** and **visual localization**. My enthusiasm for the **Autonomous Vehicles (AV) industry** drives my commitment to contributing to its growth. I aim to create innovative systems that redefine mobility and enhance everyday life.

Feel free to explore my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10t_kxd7ZiciEmRUfQRW1Gxcur3Gt2jth/view?usp=sharing) or reach out—I’d love to connect!
