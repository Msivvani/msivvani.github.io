### Project Description
This project focused on enhancing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) performance by integrating SuperPoint features into the VINS framework. The goal was to improve the robustness and repeatability of feature detection, particularly in challenging visual environments. By replacing the baseline VINS feature detector with SuperPoint, the system achieved superior localization accuracy and reliability.

### Key Contributions
1. **Integration of SuperPoint:**
   - SuperPoint, a deep learning-based keypoint detector and descriptor, was integrated into the VINS pipeline to replace the classical feature detector.
   - Improved robustness in detecting keypoints under challenging conditions such as low light, repetitive patterns, and motion blur.

2. **Keypoint Detection and Matching:**
   - SuperPoint provided higher repeatability and robustness in keypoint matching across frames.
   - Enhanced feature matching accuracy, leading to improved pose estimation and reduced drift.

3. **Seamless Integration:**
   - Modified the VINS framework to support real-time operation with SuperPoint, ensuring compatibility with existing system modules.
