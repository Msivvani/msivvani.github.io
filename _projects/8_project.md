### Approach
1. **Data Collection and Reconstruction:**  
   - Curated a dataset of 900+ images using an Intel RealSense D435 depth camera.
   - Performed dense 3D reconstruction of the scene using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques.
   - Created a detailed 3D model of the target scene for subsequent pose estimation.

2. **6D Pose Estimation and Motion Planning:**
   - Utilized the Deep Object Pose Estimation model to compute the real-time 6D pose of objects.
   - Integrated vision-driven motion generation to optimize grasping precision by detecting the optimal grasp points for the robotic arm.
